# Random Nearby Reastaurant Generator

## Website Basic Description
This website uses the Google Maps API to search for restaurants within a specified radius and returns a random restaurant so that you don't have to think about where you want to eat!

## Installation requirements/instructions

After cloning the a99-null repository, navigate to the backend folder(\a99-null\backend) and run
- ```npm install```
- ```npm start```

 In another terminal, navigate to the front end folder (a99-null\frontend\frontend) and run:
- ```npm install```
- ```npm start```

This will install all dependencies needed for the website and run both the front and back end simultaneously
